Spring PHP emerged from my need for a true Web MVC framework that was deployable on a shared LAMP hosting environment.  After looking at many PHP frameworks, none seemed to fit the requirements:

  * PHP4 & PHP5
  * Object Oriented - work with objects rather than global arrays and functions
  * MVC2 design model - controllers push the model to views
  * IoC Container - to eliminate implementation-specific dependencies between objects
  * Light Weight
  * Simple Installation - no complex deployment, no command line, no compilation
  * No use of large-scale libraries like PEAR
  * No templating language to learn - uses native PHP for views
  * Completely flexible
  * Easily portable to Java (Spring Framework)
  * Broad compatibility - able to be deployed across many environments
  * Performance - but not at the cost of flexibility
  * Self-contained and configurable libraries for specific features
  * No "spaghetti code" processing flow to understand
  * Fosters, if not demands, clean, maintainable, and TESTABLE code
  * Integrated logging for easier debugging
  * Able to quickly integrate external libraries

The goals of the Spring Framework for Java hold true for Spring PHP:

  * Make developing a complete webapp in PHP easier and LESS COMPLEX
  * Promote good programming using best practices & proven design patterns
  * Reduce the need for "reinventing the wheel"
  * Make existing technologies easier to use
  * Provide one consistent method for configuring the application
  * Whenever possible, your application code should NOT depend upon SpringPHP APIs
